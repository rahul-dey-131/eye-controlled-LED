# eye-controlled-LED
Here's a **mini description** perfect for the top of your GitHub README:  ---  **A computer vision + Arduino mini project that detects eye openness using MediaPipe Face Mesh and controls an LED accordingly. The system dynamically adjusts sensitivity based on face distance (10–60 cm) using an ultrasonic sensor.**
